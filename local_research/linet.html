    <h1>Esplanade Roger Linet</h1>
    <p>Roger Linet (1914-2003) was a trade unionist and politician for the French Commmunist Party. Taught as a metal worker, he became an active member of the metal union and French Communist Party in the early 1930s. After escaping prison during the German occupation of Paris in 1940, he became one of the leaders of the Communist resistance in the Paris region. As a Franc-tireurs commisioner, he was again arrested in 1943 and deported to the Dachau concentration camp. After his release in 1945, he continued his work as a metal union secretary in Paris and in regional government for the Communist party.</p>
