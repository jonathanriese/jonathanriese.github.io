    <h1>Maison des Métallos (House of Steelworkers)</h1>
    <p>Built in 1881 as a factory of musical instruments, the at the time called Cuesnon house was famous for selling quality instruments to American jazz musicians. After the economic crisis, it was sold to the Metalworkers’ Union (UFM) in 1837, where is got its name from. It was used for administrative services, a canteen and entertainment facilities. It became the seat of strong political actions throughout the 20th century, such as the Parisian resistance against the German occupation during WW2. The adjacent <a href="linet.html">Esplanade de Roger Linet</a> and <a href="timbaud.html">Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud</a> were both named after two important UFM officials and leaders of the resistance. The city of Paris bought the building from the UFM in 2000, and it is now used as a cultural establishment.</p>
